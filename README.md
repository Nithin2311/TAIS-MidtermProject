üö® Troubleshooting
Common Issues & Solutions
-CUDA Out of Memory:	Reduce batch size to 8 in config.py
-Dataset Download Failed:	Check internet connection; URL: https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1QWJo26V-95XF1uGJKKVnnf96uaclAENk
-Import Errors:	Run pip install -r requirements.txt
-Gradio Not Loading:	Check firewall settings or use share=True in launch()

Performance Tips
-Use Google Colab Pro for faster GPU training
-Enable FP16 training in config.py
-Reduce MAX_LENGTH to 256 for faster inference
-Use batch processing for multiple resumes
